## About me 😊

Passionate about technology and always looking for the learning of new things that contribute to my professional and personal growth. I am good at learning new skills and programming languages, responsive design principles, website optimization and problem solving.

So far in my professional career I have worked with Vanilla JavaScript, JQuery, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, GraphQL, PHP, TypeScript, VTEX platform and Scrum.

And always seeking to learn some new cool stuff 📚
